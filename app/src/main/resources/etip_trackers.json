Maximum yield is not being realized, and valuable revenue is being left on the table. Adincube Intelligent Mediation solves this problem.\r\n\r\nThrough one simple integration, Adincube Intelligent Mediation uses artificial intelligence to boost publishers' ad revenue by an average of 218%. The SDK optimizes revenue between all demand sources and buying metrics on the market, ensuring maximum yield from every single impression. Additionally, it gathers publishers\u2019 earnings and pays out immediately.\r\n\r\nHow does Adincube Intelligent Mediation work?\r\n\r\nOne SDK plugs publishers into all demand sources on the market eliminating the need for adapters or manual set up of individual accounts. Adincube Intelligent Mediation technology then analyses every available campaign, ad network, ad exchange, buying metric, and creative format in real-time, at ad request level.",

To do this, clients and data providers may use ID synching to enable the use of this information through the Platform.\"  \r\n\r\n\"... The Platform enables AppNexus's clients to collect, buy, and sell data and to use Platform Data to buy and sell online advertising. Sometime AppNexus staff give \"hands-on\" help to clients using the Platform for these purposes, for example by configuring advertising campaigns for clients to best meet their objectives.\"\r\n\r\n\"... The AppNexus Platform allows clients to provide and share Platform Data with each other.  Clients also have access to their Platform Data that they collect, acquire, or use on the Platform, and may remove it from the Platform for their own use. AppNexus may provide Platform Data to service providers in order to provide, operate, manage, maintain, and enhance AppNexus' services. AppNexus may provide, or enable others to collect, information for purposes of protecting the safety and security of the online ecosystem, including to detect and prevent malicious activity or fake traffic.

We also prohibit certain categories of sensitive data from being collected, used, or transferred on the Platform.\"  \r\n\r\n_Opt-Out:_ In browsers, AppNexus offers an opt-out web browser cookie to opt out of interest-based advertising. On mobile, AppNexus lists an opt-out option through general device settings in Android and iOS. In Android, the setting is \"Opt out of Interest-Based Ads\". To stop location collection, AppNexus tells users to either change the preferences on their device or adjust settings in individual apps.  \r\n\r\n_Data Retention:_ AppNexus retains data according to \"industry standards\". \"Platform Data is stored using generally accepted security standards. It is usually aggregated or deleted within 30-60 days, but may be retained in the Platform for up to 18 months from the date of collection before aggregation or deletion.

These are detailed in the Techology section under Details, below.\r\n\r\nServices provided by Salesforce DMP include:  \r\n\r\n* Accerlated Mobile Pages (facilitate mobile-optimized content)\r\n* Cross Device Identity Mangement (identify individuals across devices)\r\n* Salesforce DMP Einstein Segmentation (segment multiple personas in an audience)\r\n* Tracking (re-identify and track users using various methods)\r\n* Hashed device management (tracking used in reaction to Safari 3rd party blocking)\r\n* User matching (match users with various techniques to identify individuals)\r\n* Ad Server analytics (understand and analyze audience segment delivery and yield across all ad impressions)\r\n* Content engagement reports (loyalty report cards, site visits, and more)\r\n* Frequency engagement reports (how many times a user has seen an ad)\r\n* Funnels report (track customer behaviors across their customer journey)\r\n* Look-alike modeling (\r\n* Audience Profile Report (such as age, gender, and household income)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n**Opting out**   \r\n_DMP Opt-Out_ \"DMP Opt-Out\r\nhttps://apiservices.krxd.net/consumer/optout is the standard DMP opt-out URL. When called directly, this URL will execute the Opt-out action for a user and it will return the following JSON response:\r\n\r\n{\"code\":\"success\"}\r\n\r\nA user must allow cookies from Salesforce DMP in order to opt-out. Calling the DMP opt-out code (by clicking on an opt-out button placed on the client's page) will result in a persistent 'cookie' placed in the user\u2019s web browser by Salesforce, identifying that user as being on the Salesforce DMP 'do not target' list. Taking this opt-out step won't prevent all tracking and targeting online, but it will ensure the user\u2019s wishes are honored by all Salesforce DMP clients.\r\n\r\nNote: If the user uses more than one computer, the process must be repeated for each one as this information is associated with a cookie unique to each machine.\" [Salesforce, 7](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/217039187-Privacy-Policy-and-Opt-Out-Guide)\r\n\r\n_On Mobile:_ \"Users can reset their IDFA or AdID to receive a new one. This is comparable to deleting cookies.\r\n\r\nThey can also block these completely by opting-out of Ad Track or Ads Personalization. In that case, Salesforce DMP cannot track or target these users.\" [Salesforce, 3](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428127-Mobile-IDs-FAQ)\r\n\r\n_In Safari FAQ:_ \"Is there any difference in the how 1st-party cookies and Hashed Device IDs treat opt-outs?\r\nYes, if the client is utilizing a first-party cookie and has multiple domains, a dedicated opt-out will need to be configured and maintained for each site. Alternatively, if hashed device management is employed a single opt-out link will be applicable for a given client.\r\n\r\nCan users opt-out of Hashed ID tracking?\r\nAbsolutely \u2013 unlike other providers of so-called Fingerprinting techniques, the Salesforce DMP actually can manage fingerprinting users through an opt-out. \r\n\r\nDoes Fingerprinting adhere to PII rules?\r\nYes, our hashed device management solution is fully compliant with PII protocols.\r\n\r\nDo both approaches lose uses when they clear their cookies?\r\nNo, first-party cookies can be cleared, while the hashed ID will persist even if cookies are emptied. [Salesforce, 4](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428307-Safari-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Can users opt-out of tracking in Mobile Apps?\r\nUsers can reset their IDFA or AdID to receive a new one. This is comparable to deleting cookies.\r\n\r\nThey can also block these completely by opting-out of Ad Track or Ads Personalization. In that case, Salesforce DMP cannot track or target these users.\" [Salesforce, 58](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428127-Mobile-IDs-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Personally Identifiable Information**  \r\n\"Personally Identifiable Information (PII) includes any data that could potentially identify a specific individual and can be used for de-anonymizing data. Salesforce does not collect or store PII.\"\r\n\r\nSome examples of PII include: Full name; Email address; Phone numbers; Credit card numbers; Date of birth; Login/screen name; IP address is considered PII in some countries outside of the US; Home address; etc\" [Salesforce, 8](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007222048-PII)\r\n\r\n**Data Privacy and Security Considerations**\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP does not accept PII data and it is a breach of the MSA to send to us. Onboarding might be a better option if you have data connected to email addresses and are concerned with offline data import user matching.

Using Salesforce DMP, organizations can consolidate and reconcile their first-party \"web-behavior\" data that is generated by consumers as they engage with media and/or content with data from various third-party data providers like eXelate, DataLogix, Targus etc. Organizations can also integrate data from their user registration and subscription databases (hereon referred to as \u201cfirst-party data\u201d) into Salesforce DMP and join that data with web behavior and third-party data. \r\n\r\nUser data stored in Salesforce DMP is keyed off a global Krux User ID. The Krux User ID is a third-party cookie and as such is specific to a browser (and corresponding device too). All data that is collected by Salesforce DMP from online environments is automatically keyed off the Krux User ID.\r\n\r\nSalesforce DMP supports the ingestion of first-party data available in client systems like registration or subscription databases and other CRM systems. This data is keyed off the client\u2019s first-party User ID. A User Matching process that maps the client first-party User ID to the corresponding Krux User ID for every applicable user facilitates the onboarding and ingestion of this data. \r\n\r\nAfter the user matching process has been setup clients can send first-party data corresponding to the matched users. Salesforce DMP has a strict data format for the first-party data outlined below.\" [Salesforce, 32](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/214918988-First-Party-Data-Import)\r\n\r\n_Billing Clients:_ Clients are charged for impressions, and a maximum amount for a single impression is calculate: [Salesforce, 34](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011719688-How-Data-Costs-are-Billed)\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\n**AMP for Mobile Tracking**  \r\nAMP stands for \u2018Accelerated Mobile Pages\u2019 and is designed to facilitate mobile-optimized content. A notable aspect of the design is that it keeps 3rd party JavaScript out as much as possible to improve performance, however, there are AMP libraries available to provide additional rich content.\"  \r\n\r\nSee AMP FAQ for more: [Salesforce, 56](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428507-AMP-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Cross Device Identity Mangement (Declarative and Predictive)**  \r\nPredictive DCIM costs an extra fee.  \"The Predictive CDIM report describes all of the devices associated with people already in a given segment.  It allows you to identify and map consumers and behavior patterns consistently across all devices, screens, and platforms.\"\r\n\r\n_Key features include_: \"Connects known and unknown devices (declared and predictive) / Create a CDIM segment directly from the report / Aggregate audiences and their data across devices / A choice of similarity levels allows you to consider the trade off between accuracy and scale\".  _Key benefits include_: \"Improves reach, relevance, and inventory monetization / Increases your opportunity to sequence ads, at optimal frequency, for consistent messaging and experience across channels, throughout the journey / Delivers accurate analytics for segment profiles and campaign conversions?\r\n\r\n_Probablistic Matching:_  \r\n\"How does the probabilistic matching algorithm work?\r\n\r\nThe core of the model is designed to uncover the devices that stay together in various places over long periods of time. To do this effectively there are three important considerations - scale, training, and validation.\r\n\r\n* Scale - Because the success of the model is predicated on seeing lots of devices and how they move over time, it is essential to have massive reach into the device world. With one of the largest device footprints on the planet, Salesforce DMP has an advantageous position from which to deliver accurate results.\r\n* Training - Salesforce DMP uses deterministic data coming from authenticated events (logins, purchases, etc) to provide a truth set for training the algorithm.\r\n* Validation - From the deterministic data set, Salesforce DMP reserves some data to validate the efficacy of the model.\r\n\r\nBetween these three items we are able to continuously improve the accuracy of the predictions and deliver a better product.\r\n\r\nTo better understand the view of devices over time, consider a user's work and home movement. During the work day, all of the user's devices are likely to be tied to the same IP from work. However, colleagues are also tied to the same IP and in that single snapshot of time, it may be assumed the user and their colleagues are the same person.\r\n\r\nLooking at that same IP address at night, there is likely no activity, as everyone has left the office. When looking at the user's home IP at night, all of the devices that belong to that user and their family are tied to the same IP. That single snapshot might imply that the usr and their family are one \"person\".\r\n\r\n_Predicting with device composition:_ \"Device Composition: Salesforce DMP uses predictive cookie matching to fill in the gaps where cookies may not be present, such as mobile apps, Safari browser, ad blocking software, etc. However, because Google is looking for active audience cookies, the two systems use different logic around device composition. If your segment includes a high volume of non-stable cookies (mobile/Safari/cookie-less devices), that can impact the match rate.\" [Salesforce, 37](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010886887-DFP-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Each user creates multiple Krux User IDs (KUIDS) - cookies in browsers as well as IDFAs or AdIDs for mobile apps. Once our cross devices algorithm identifies that two of these KUIDs belong to the same person, we increase the count of \"people\" by one and select one of the KUIDs to be the \"leading\" KUID. We call this the one the \"Uber ID\". \r\n\r\nThere are some rules in place to determine which of the KUIDs is elected the Uber ID. This evaluation can change from day to day. If the Uber ID KUID is not active for a couple of days, it loses it's status as Uber ID. In this special case, the Uber ID is removed from the segment population list and shown accordingly as \"deleted\". \r\n\r\nIt is mainly Safari users to contribute to these Uber ID changes, as on Safari each page impression created a unique new KUID.\" [Salesforce, 54](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006652948-Segment-Processing-FAQ)\r\n\r\n**Salesforce DMP Einstein**   \r\n\"Salesforce DMP Einstein Segmentation, which allows marketers to use machine learning to discover the multiple distinct personas that exist within their audience.\r\n\r\nUsing Einstein AI, on top of unified consumer data from both first and third-party sources, enables us to algorithmically determine the \u201cpersonas\u201d that best define a brand\u2019s audience. Now, companies can personalize marketing and reach each key persona with a message that is going to resonate, rather than blasting a one-size-fits-all retargeting message to everyone that happened to land on a particular webpage. For example, Conagra Brands has seen dramatic results by customizing the messages to different consumer personas for its Hunt\u2019s brand.\r\n\r\nThis is a great example of how our data management layer consisting of first, second, and third-party data can feed our growing AI layer to create tangible value for marketers\" [Salesforce, 1](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/05/krux-is-now-salesforce-dmp.html)\"\r\n\r\n**Tracking**    \r\n_Device strategies & KUIDs:_ \"We differentiate between Mobile Web and Mobile App. Mobile work works just like Desktop Web with KUIDs stored as 3rd Party cookies.

Since it's not a 3rd party cookie \u2013 even though we are acting as an agent of our clients \u2013 it means that we are unable to sync those users with a 3rd party data provider unless the 3rd party fires a match pixel.\r\n [Salesforce, 4](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428307-Safari-FAQ)\r\n\r\n_CDIM & Hashing:_ \"What makes Salesforce's Hashed ID different from competitive offerings?\r\nThere are a few vendors outside of Salesforce who provide Hashed Device IDs, however, they do not couple it with a CDIM solution. This enables Salesforce to associate Safari activity within a larger, holistic set of that individual\u2019s data and utilize Safari activity within a larger conversion path.\r\n\r\nHow can you tell if other providers offering Hashed Device Management solutions are accurate or employing CDIM?\r\nIf or when you hear really high numbers of unique users (UUs) reported against Safari, it often means that they are not resolving the browser down to a single user; each page view counts as a UU in Safari if you don't have a CDIM solution.\" [Salesforce, 4](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000428307-Safari-FAQ)\r\n\r\n\"Do users have a KUID in Mobile Devices?\r\nWe differentiate between Mobile Web and Mobile App. Mobile work works just like Desktop Web with KUIDs stored as 3rd Party cookies.

Match rate is the percentage of users of party A known by party B.  SF DMP match rates exclude Safari and app IDs.  Increased match rates create greater scale, and \"Greater audience scale creates more options for managing and optimizing campaign tactics such as segmentation, personalized messaging, frequency, omni channel journey, etc.\"  Because of 3rd party blocking, **Safari users can typicaly not be matched to partners at all.** \r\n\r\n\"By default, we run user match pixels on client\u2019s websites through the Control Tag for all partners a client is working with. We fire it on all pages with a frequency cap of 3 times over a 24-hour period for a given user. This will ensure return users are matched, but will not overwhelm client\u2019s sites with unnecessary tag fires. We set the tag to fire \"immediately\" to make sure users are matched before leaving the page. \r\n\r\nIt will take up to 30 days for the match rate to reach its peak after a new user match pixel has been activated.\r\n\r\nUnlike first party data that is exclusively available to the client who owns it, user match tables are shared across all Salesforce DMP clients. This way, each client can benefit from the user match pixels being fired on other client\u2019s websites.\r\n\r\nSalesforce has one of the largest footprints in the industry, thus providing exceptionally high match rates. Match rates can vary from country to country though, depending on both Salesforce's and the partner\u2019s footprint in that market.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible for partners to fire the Salesforce DMP user match pixel across all their inventory to improve the match rate upon request.\" [Salesforce, 23](https://konsole.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006072448-User-Matching-and-Match-Rates-FAQ)\r\n\r\nCritically, \"The Client User ID will have a one-to-many relationship with the Krux User ID in the User Match table. Note that in general, there may be multiple Krux User IDs mapped to a given Client User ID because the Krux User ID is browser specific whereas the Client User ID will be the same across multiple browsers (assuming that it is indeed a persistent user ID as opposed to a first-party cookie).\"\r\n\r\n\"For example, if there are 3 columns called Age Group, Gender, and Interest in the client\u2019s registration database that need to be imported into Salesforce DMP, then the following represents a valid data file that can be ingested by Salesforce DMP:\r\n\r\nUser1234^gender:male;age:18-24;interest:fishing\r\nUser2345^gender:female\r\nUser3456^age:35-44\r\nUser4567^gender:male;interest:fishing,boating\r\n\r\nWhen Salesforce DMP processes this file, we will create 3 attributes called Gender, Age, and Interest in the client\u2019s Salesforce DMP account.

This includes Safari cookies, as per default Safari deleted all cookies after each page impression. A DSP Safari cookie will never show up again and thus can't be served ads to. Many DSPs also don't accept mobile identifiers (IDFA and AdID). So in those cases we also deduct them.\r\n\r\nSegment Match Rate is the percentage of users from the matchable population that we have matched the DSPs cookie against within the last 30 days.

Users are refered to the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s [website](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!%2F) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) [website](http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) regarding cookies and interest-based advertising.

Some services include:\r\n\r\n* _Segmenting:_ \"Build, test, and activate...audiences...based on a set of traits\". \"Divide millions of records into trait-specific categories\" like \"moms of grade school kids\". Find new prospects with \"look-alike modeling\"; \"pinpoint your most frequent users, as well as how recently they've interacted with your marketing.\" \r\n* _Cross-device identification:_ Use the \"profiling feature\" in Audience Manager \"to tie one profile to multiple devices\" and \"discover if users are sharing a device, for instance, within a household\". Target customers \"after they may logged off your site or app.\"\r\n* _Reports:_ Generate reports like Optimal Frequency reports, Advertiser Performance Reports to gain insight about user interactions like impressions, clicks, and conversions \r\n* _Predictive analytics:_ Performs predictive analytics\r\n* Organize your own first party data and augment it with second or third party data with the Audience Marketplace feature\r\n* Price your data for sale and partners [Adobe, 19](https://www.adobe.com/data-analytics-cloud/audience-manager.html)\r\n* _Geotargeting and location-based targeting:_ Adobe Mobile Marketing offers \"support for many location services, including GPS, geofencing, beacons, and more\". Geolocation services allow marketers to \"measure and respond to user engagement in mobile apps connected to beacons in sports stadiums, retail stores, and other points of interest. Marketers can also easily deliver \u201clocal\u201d notifications and promotions based on proximity to a beacon. In addition, companies can tie app interactions to all other app engagement data in Adobe Analytics\" [Adobe, 23](https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/mobile/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-adobes-mobile-marketing).

Retargeting campaign    \r\n\r\nTheir service is designed to protect retailers for \"showcasing\" whereby consumers view products in retail stores and look for prices and promotions found elsewhere, especially online.  \"Thus,\" Fidzup states, \"those consumers who move to a point of sale but do not buy represent a real 'blind spot' for the brand.\"\r\n\r\nGeofencing technologies make it possible to know precisely the location of the consumer and offer new possibilities to harness data for retailers in stores and leverage the same techniques available to retailers in the online space. This helps retailers:\r\n\r\n* Know when the consumer goes to the store, whether they shop or not\r\n* Target their communication with contextualized promotions, or additional services to better inform the consumer during its purchase process\" [Marketing-Professionnel.fr, 01](http://www.marketing-professionnel.fr/parole-expert/distribution-retail-geofencing-geolocalisation-indooor-201411.html)  \r\n\r\nFidzup's technology also helps retailers generate in-store traffic through targeting \"specific mobile audiences in your catchment area having an affinity with your brand.\"  \r\n\r\nFidzup's in-store tracking helps retailers retarget customers who physically visited their store, according to their in-store behavior.  According to Fidzup, their \"Fidzup Retargeting currently manages to detect 40% of point-of-sale traffic, more than 80% of smartphones... Thanks to point-of-sale technologies, Fidzup Retargeting is able to measure the ROI of all the campaigns sent (store visit, download of the application, etc.) and to report to the company. This marketing tool is therefore much more effective than a classic advertising campaign, because it occurs at the psychological moment when the user considers the purchase and allows to finalize the sale it is done in store or on its m-commerce site\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\nFidzup's technology helps retailers target competitor prospects to \"Serve ads to customers and prospects of retail/brand competitors\" [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en).\r\n\r\n_Advertised services for clients:_   \r\n\r\nStores:  \r\n1.

Continuous innovation and improvement help us to develop more and more relevant and quicker and quicker solutions to install for our customers\" [Fidzup, 02](https://www.fidzup.com/en/team). Their ambition is to \"Provide physical commerce with the tools that pure players now enjoy\". Where on the web professionals are able to identify a highly qualified target to better send them promotions, no solution existed for retailers to recover these prospects.\r\n\r\nSince its creation in 2011, Fidzup was working on an indoor presence detection technology. The idea was to offer retailers and shopping centers a light technology to deploy and without constraint of use for consumers. This is how Fidzup Microtargeting was created, a platform for sending interactive and location-based content on the mobile of visitors to points of sale. It is the explosion of Criteo, the French giant of online advertising retargeting, which pushed the Fidzup teams to pivot towards a similar solution, but to the brick & mortar business. Since the startup was already able to understand the behavior of consumers in points of sale.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, where Criteo is interested in the behavior of Internet users on e-commerce sites to retarget advertising on partner media pages, Fidzup is interested in the consumer shopper journey in physical stores to address contextualized advertising. on its mobile apps\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).  \r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Mobile (Android, Apple) / Fidbox\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_ \r\n\r\n* \"Online Offline: Performance mobile marketing for retailers\" [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en)\r\n* \"An innovative technology for interior presence detection\" \r\n* \"A mailing platform for geolocalized interactive content\" [Fidzup v2, 01](http://archive.is/kUZGK)  \r\n\r\n### Methods\r\nFidzup \"has developed 3 solutions to detect the presence of a consumer in stores: Fidzup Microtargeting, Fidzup Retargeting and Fidzup Analytics. These technologies, easily deployable, are based on the principle of indoor geolocation (operating by wifi, ultrasound or BLE) and broadcast interactive content on smartphone. Thus, Fidzup captures and reactivates the consumer or simple visitor, either directly at the point of sale, or when he leaves the sign\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\nBig Data / Predictive analytics / Programmatic / RTB  \r\n\r\n_Consumer targeting:_ Geographical/store / Digital navigation (on devices) / Habits / Purchase intention  \r\n\r\n\"The most accurate in-store tracking technology on the market.  Measure your online campaigns ROI with adapted offline KPIs\"  \r\n_Fidbox:_   \r\n  * Works without any mobile app  \r\n  * 3 meters accuracy; 4 years of R&D, 2 patents registered  \r\n  * Autonomous in-store sensor [Fidzup, 01](https://www.fidzup.com/en)\r\n\r\nFidbox is \"compatible with 99.9% of smartphones\". Fidboxes \"capture an encrypted identification key, unique to mobile, that Fidzup Retargeting then found on the ad servers. These captured data will be processed to segment the audience of the target brand to address on AdExchanges. This process will thus make it possible to resort to an advertising retargeting by displaying a personalized banner, according to the offline consumption habits of the mobile user, when he / she consults a third-party application (games, news, sports, etc.).\" Fidzup's \"point-of-sale deployment is lightweight and does not require any particular mobile application.\"    \r\n\r\n_Fidzup Retargeting:_ Fidzup's \"Totally innovative process allows the Terrasses du Port not to lose its consumers, increase its customer knowledge and optimize its media buying campaigns by addressing a qualified target. Fidzup Retargeting can also measure the visits of the consumer and know the generated downloads in a logic of measurement of the ROI of the carried out campaigns.\"  \r\n\r\n_Fidzup Microtargeting:_ Fidzup's microtargeting is \"based on the principle of indoor geofencing and allows shopping centers & retailers to interact instantly with their customers via their smartphone at their points of sale.\" It \"relies on the use of a sound source to send data to a smartphone that will decode and process the received signal. More concretely, Fidzup broadcasts via point of sale via any audio source (speaker system broadcasting music, sound boxes, televisions, etc.) a signal inaudible to the human ear. This signal has the particularity of having a unique identifier corresponding to a specific location. The detection is done when the smartphone receives the signal and decodes it to know where the consumer is.\r\n\r\nFidzup Microtargeting then automatically triggers the sending of interactive and contextualized content on the mobile of the consumer according to his position. Discount coupons, targeted promotion on a product upon entry into the corresponding department, exceptional opening information, contests triggered as soon as they enter the store ... For example, a brand wishes to launch a promotion on its polos: \"1 polo bought, the 2nd to -50% \u00bbFor this, she will have the choice between sending the promotion on the mobile of the consumer as soon as it enters the store or the entrance of the department concerned by the promotion.\r\n\r\nThe consumer then receives relevant content, at the right place and at the best time on his smartphone. With Fidzup technology, the sales area is 'squared': either at the entrance of the store itself or within a specific radius, it is possible for each manager to choose the right place, where the visitor will receive interactive content.  \r\n\r\n...Unlike other solutions that require the deployment of a heavy hardware device, and therefore expensive to install and maintain, the technology developed by Fidzup can be deployed without any hardware installation on site if the audio system used is remotely controllable. Indeed, some companies have specialized in the implementation of audio systems, the distribution of music in point of sale can be controlled online. These players cover a majority of the retail and retail market. If, however, the customer is not equipped, Fidzup has developed a battery of inexpensive hardware solutions that are easy to install.\r\n\r\n- Mobile Compatibility: The software brick developed by Fidzup (the SDK) integrates with applications running on iOS mobile OS (iPhone) and Android. Thus, thanks to Fidzup technology it is possible to reach more than 90% of the global mobile market.\r\n\r\n- Use: In the face of the few players capable of detecting presence at the point of sale, Fidzup chose to specialize in consumer care once it is present. Thus, the startup has developed the lightest solution to send promotional content at the best time to maximize efficiency. The end customer has no action to do (except to download the application of the sign or the mall), it is the content that comes to him automatically and at a time when he will be attentive. Since the media is mobile, it is essential to offer end users a limited number of actions to perform for a simple and fluid use.\"   \r\n\r\nThis can result in real-time data mining: \"Since the operations implemented are mainly digital, La Vache Noire has the possibility to follow in real time the impact of its operation (participation rate, winning prizes, etc.).\"  This can bring businesses that did not previously data mine into the data mining fold: \"Finally, the marketing department of the center has retained a certain interest from brands that have never participated so much in a digital transaction. Thus, prestigious brands such as Celio, Jules, Yves Rocher or Darjeeling participate each week in the operation 'List of promotions'\"  [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\n\"Fidzup has developed a means of communication between a sonic emitter and a mobile phone. Thus, by diffusing a tone, inaubible to the human ear, inside a building we can detect the presence of mobile phones and therefore their owners. How does the detection work? Your visitors must have the mobile application already installed on their smartphone. This contains a software layer (a SDK supplied by Fidzup) capable of detecting the signals and decoding them. What kind of sonic emitter can be used? It is possible to use any audio source to diffuse the signals. In fact, Fidzup has come up with a variety of hardware solutions depending on the user\u2019s requirements.  \r\n\r\n... We supply you with one or several bespoke sonic signals to diffuse in your establishment. Depending on the type of building and the type of usage you require, Fidzup offers a choice of several hardware and software solutions to simplify and optimize the diffusion of its sonic technology. Depending on the method of emission chosen, a sonic signal can be used to cover a precise zone of a store, the corridors of a shopping mall or even detect a visitor admiring a work of art in an art exhibition.\"   \r\n\r\n... \"Installing the SDK into your mobile application: We supply you with a software layer (SDK) to add to your mobile application. this layer detects and decodes the audio signal. The SDK is supplied with full documentation to help you install it swiftly and easily into your mobile application.The SDK is compatible with both iOS (iPhone) and Android operating systems.  Minimum requirement for the iOS operating system: iOS version 5; Minimum requirement for the Android operating system: Android 2.3.5 (HTC One X not supported)\" [Fidzup v2, 02](https://web.archive.org/web/20171015025307/http://v2.fidzup.com/en//notre-solution).\r\n\r\n_Fidzup Analytics:_ \"Fidzup Analytics is a technology based on wifi that analyzes the traffic in points of sale, especially for shopping centers and supermarkets. Coupled with the Fidzup Retargeting solution, this technology makes it possible to capture on average 40% of the real traffic, whether the consumers / visitors are carriers of the application of the center or not.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the handling of its solution, Fidzup gives direct access to the Analytics interface to the shopping center teams. The management can then see the route taken by its visitors from one store to another and analyze the data retrieved by day, week or month. Thus, Fidzup Analytics is able to display the traffic generated in the point of sale, the average duration of a visit, its frequency and to couple all these data to highlight trends or peaks of affluence. For the management of the center, the interest of these crossings of data is of size: to be able to identify the typical course of a customer and thus to define the zones \"cold\" or \"hot\" of the shopping mall (that is to say to say the locations more or less visited). Thanks to Fidzup Analytics, retail professionals can have a perfect knowledge of their customers, their habits in the center, but also know if their rental spaces are properly valued according to the passage of visitors. Finally, with the Analytics solution, shopping centers now have the opportunity to measure the audience generated by their communication devices already in place (promotional video screen, POS, display, totem ...). Indeed, depending on the information provided on these media, Fidzup is able to know the impact on the shopping journey of the customer and sales\"   [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).\r\n\r\n\"Fidzup\u2019s Programmatic & Analytics Platform is made up of DSP, DMP and Tag management solutions, developed in-house for bricks-and-mortar stores.

This solution is ideal for small spaces with no audio system in place.  \r\n- Standalone emitter unit: This mains connected unit allows you to broadcast your sound signal continuously in the manner of a portable and independent speaker enclosure. This solution is ideal for creating an interactive zone in a specific area of your establishment.   \r\n- Mixer emitter unit: The mixer unit, also mains connected, can automatically mix your signal sound with the music played through your audio system. This solution is ideal for users wishing to cover all areas of their establishment through their own public address system.   \r\n- Custom installation: Your audio system is managed by an external provider? No problem, Fidzup can work with them to simplify the deployment, as it could then be managed remotely, without any hardware installation in situ\" [Fidzup, 03](http://www.fidzup.com/fidzup-2015.zip).  \r\n\r\n_Web interface:_ \"We give you secure access to an administrative interface that allows you to devise promotional content that will be displayed on visitors\u2019 smartphones as soon as they are detected in your establishment.

They also store a record of the ads they serve in their logs. Log data includes \"your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\" They anonymize the log data by \"removing part of the IP address (after 9 months) and cookie information (after 18 months)\". Google services, such as AdWords, AdSense, and a range of DoubleClick-branded services, may send cookies to your bro]]wser when you visit a page or see an ad that uses one of these services.  \r\n\r\n_Other technologies:_ Google may \"select advertising based on information about your computer or device, such as your device model, browser type, or sensors in your device like the accelerometer.\"  \r\n\r\n_Location:_ Google may infer your location \"from a variety of sources\", including your IP address, search queries, as well as you \"precise location from your mobile device\" and \"websites or apps that you use may send information about your location\" to Google.  Google \"uses location information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to report aggregate statistics to advertiser.\"  \r\n\r\n_Mobile tracking:_ When cookies are not available (eg, in mobile devices), Google \"may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.\"\r\n\r\n_Opt-out and user control:_ Users can control cookie tracking through Google Ad Settings, consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, and through the management of cookies in web browser settings. Users can opt out of personalized ads in apps through Android and iOS device settings [Google, 06](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads).\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nDoubleClick was founded in 1995 [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doubleclick).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _AppsFlyer, 01._ https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003213726-DoubleClick-Integration-Guide  \r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doubleclick\r\n* _DoubleClick, 01._ https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/google-debuts-new-ad-attribution-service  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 02._ https://support.google.com/adxseller/answer/6016023?hl=en  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 03._ https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/6281539?hl=en  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 04._ https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/bt-sport-dynamic-ad-insertion-google  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 05._ https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/solutions/revenue-management/ad-exchange  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 06._ https://support.google.com/dcm/partner/answer/4568975?hl=en  \r\n* _DoubleClick, 07._ https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_overview#using_mobile_device_id  \r\n* _Forbes, 01._ https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2017/05/23/did-that-ad-work-google-debuts-new-ai-driven-ad-attribution-service  \r\n* _Google, 01._ https://support.google.com/ds/answer/6348835?hl=en  \r\n* _Google, 02._ https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6100636?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse&hl=en-GB\r\n* _Google, 03._ https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/2884033?hl=en\r\n* _Google, 04._ https://support.google.com/richmedia/answer/3399874?hl=en  \r\n* _Google, 05, PDF._ http://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/case-study-accuweather-delivers-enhanced-value-to-advertisers-with-doubleclick-for-publishers-and-google-analytics-360.pdf\r\n* _Google, 06._ https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads\r\n* _Online-behavior.com, 01._ http://online-behavior.com/analytics/dfp-audience  \r\n* _ProPublica, 01._ https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking  \r\n* _Search Engine Land, 01._ https://searchengineland.com/google-attribution-search-marketers-need-know-275751  \r\n* _TechCrunch, 01._ https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/google-attribution-is-a-free-and-easy-way-to-evaluate-marketing-efforts  \r\n* _TechCrunch, 02._ https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/google-is-now-using-deep-learning-to-measure-store-visits \r\n\r\n## External links\r\n* _Crunchbase (DoubleClick):_ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doubleclick](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/doubleclick)\r\n* _Wikpedia (DoubleClick):_ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoubleClick)\r\n* _Ghostery (DoubleClick:_ [https://apps.ghostery.com/apps/doubleclick](https://apps.ghostery.com/apps/doubleclick)",

All giving you the tools and insights to make smarter decisions for your business. Here\u2019s how we do it:\r\n\r\nIt all starts with an accurate understanding of where someone is. GroundTruth is the largest location-based advertising platform in the world. We see 10x more people than our nearest competitor, reaching nearly a billion users a month, in more than twenty one countries around the world. And, we ensure our data is the highest quality. When someone uses a location-enabled app groundtruth\u2019s technology verifies the location signal for precision and accuracy. Each signal is run through our patented, location verification process, removing inaccuracies, filtering outliers, and analyzing patterns. This yields precise mobile location targeting data you can trust.\r\n\r\nNext we match these signals to places. Blueprints is our proprietary mapping technology, built with the specific purpose of contextualizing the offline world. We\u2019ve created blueprints for over a 100 million unique locations all over the globe. Our blueprints are dissected into multiple layers that mimic the real-world. so we can tell precisely whether a person is in a store, in the parking lot, or within walking distance of a location. This allows us to distinguish a passerby from an actual or potential customer. And for even deeper insight, there\u2019s our neighborhoods technology, which maps defined areas that show high visitation affinity to nearby stores or locations. With access to technology this powerful, marketers can take better action on offline behaviors.\r\n\r\nAll this adds up to measurable performance. Whether that\u2019s driving traffic to your site (or store), increasing sales, or enabling you to plan, predict and prepare for real consumer behaviour. Your business doesn\u2019t need guesses. It needs the reality on the ground. So, let us show you the amazing things we can do with location data that tells the truth.",

More than that, you can drill down on the users that have experienced a particular crash type or a crash that happened during a specific time period. This will help you know if the crash has affected a lot of people over a cross section of your users or if there are specific groups of people who experience the same type of crashes repeatedly.\" [Stackify, 01](https://stackify.com/what-is-hockeyapp/)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _HockeyApp, 01._ [https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/general-account-management-2/general-questions](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/general-account-management-2/general-questions)\r\n* _HockeyApp, 02._ [https://www.hockeyapp.net/features/user-metrics/](https://www.hockeyapp.net/features/user-metrics/)\r\n* _HockeyApp, 03._ [https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/app-management-2/what-data-is-collected-with-the-hockeysdks-2#data-collected-for-the-user-metrics-features](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/app-management-2/what-data-is-collected-with-the-hockeysdks-2#data-collected-for-the-user-metrics-features)\r\n* _HockeyApp, 04._ [https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/general-account-management-2/getting-started-with-user-metrics](https://support.hockeyapp.net/kb/general-account-management-2/getting-started-with-user-metrics)\r\n* _HockeyApp, 05._ [https://www.hockeyapp.net/blog/2014/12/11/hockeyapp-joins-microsoft.html](https://www.hockeyapp.net/blog/2014/12/11/hockeyapp-joins-microsoft.html)\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bit-stadium-gmbh](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bit-stadium-gmbh)\r\n* _Bloomberg, 01._ [https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=279701634](https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=279701634)\r\n* _Stackify, 01._ [https://stackify.com/what-is-hockeyapp/](https://stackify.com/what-is-hockeyapp/)\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n* _Crunchbase (HockeyApp):_ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bit-stadium-gmbh](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bit-stadium-gmbh)\r\n* _Wikipedia (List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft):_ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft#cite_note-195](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Microsoft#cite_note-195)\r\n* _Owler company profile:_ [https://www.owler.com/iaApp/1149223/hockeyapp-company-profile](https://www.owler.com/iaApp/1149223/hockeyapp-company-profile)",

Sites and apps that integrate the OM SDK can send measurement signals to an API, the Open Measurement Interface Definition (OMID).

They include:\r\n\r\n* _Messaging:_ Send push notifications, in-app messages, email, and more, using wide broadcasts or personalized content. Deliver messages with \"triggers or drip campaigns across the customer lifecycle\". Other targeting strategies include \"onboarding, engagement, conversion, reactivation, and loyalty\" [Leanplum, 05](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/push-notifications-messaging).\r\n* _Mobile Marketing Automation:_ Create \"context-rich campaigns that understand and respond to user actions\". Target users based on \"what users do and who they are\", and engage along the full customer journey. Tailor interactions based on behavior, location, timing, and channel. Automate self-activating messages in response to \"personalized behaviors\" [Leanplum, 06](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-marketing-automation).\r\n* _App Experience Command Center:_ A mobile content management system [Leanplum, 07](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/app-editor).\r\n* _App Personalization:_ Leanplum \"provides context and personalization enabled by individual user profiles that get richer over time. Demographic, behavior, location, time, and external data provide the deep insights that power relevance. The key to meaningful engagement is understanding who users are and what they do inside your app.\" They \"capture limitless user events and behaviors to fuel highly contextual messaging campaigns\" [Leanplum, 08](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/personalization).\r\n* _A/B Testing:_ Leanplum claims to have \"the most extensive mobile A/B testing solution in the industry\". Their product \"comes equipped with the ability to run A/B and multivariate tests\" to maximize return on investment [Leanplum, 09](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-ab-testing-optimization).\r\n* _Analytics:_ Leanplum's approach is to \"capture all events and behaviors associated with a user, without limits or data point costs\" in order to \"inspire real-time action\". Clients can \"customize parameters, reports, and metrics\". Insights examine \"engagement, retention, revenue, uninstalls, and more\" [Leanplum, 10](https://www.leanplum.com/platform/mobile-app-analytics).\r\n\r\nLeanplum gathers detailed user profile information and correlates with behavioral data [Leanplum, 11](https://leanplum-wordpress.storage.googleapis.com/Pers_new@1x-min.png). Their platoform is \"built on a foundation of A/B Testing and Analytics\" to deliver \"deep customer understanding\" [Leanplum, 12](https://www.leanplum.com/platform).\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nIt is not clear if Leanplum's Privacy Policy listed on its website also applies to its mobile tracker. The Privacy Policy posted on their website covers a number of topics:\r\n\r\n_PII collection:_ Leanplum collects both PII (\"personal information\") and non-PII data. They collect information that is voluntarily provided (eg, through email newsletters, accounts, or profiles users sign up for), passively provided (eg, IP address, mobile device ID, server logs, cookies, web beacons, user actions like clicks, and so on).\r\n\r\n_Third party collection:_ Leanplum \"may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties (e.g., opt-in lists where you have requested information about Leanplum or the Service while visiting a Third-Party Site). We may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in personally identifiable format\".\r\n\r\n_Data sharing:_ Leanplum states, \"Except as described in this Policy, we will not disclose your Personal Information that we collect on the Service to third parties without your consent. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in...circumstances\" involving service providers, business transfers, the protection of Leanplum's interests, and public authorities.\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ Leanplum offers an ability to opt out from the disclosure of information to third parties, as well as for use cases that are \"incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized\". Individuals must contact Leanplum by email to exercise their choice.\r\n\r\n_Access and retention:_ Individuals with user accounts or profiles on the Leanplum Service can email Leanplum requesting access to their Personal Information; they can also request to amend or update the data. Users can also request Leanplum delete their data. However, Leanplum states they \"may need to retain some of your Personal Information in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so\".\r\n\r\n_International law:_ Leanplum states it is in compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.\r\n\r\n_Security:_ Leanplum states it takes reasonable security measures, but also states that \"no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you provide to us. You transmit information to us at your own risk\" [Leanplum, 13](https://www.leanplum.com/privacy).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n_Customers:_ Grab / NBC / QVC / TED / Tinder / Zynga [Leanplum, 01](https://www.leanplum.com) / Bleacher Report / Hotwire / Macy's / Red Bull [Leanplum, 02](https://www.leanplum.com/customers) / Tesco / App Annie / Last Minute Travel / Pixowl / Mixbook / Wanelo / Pixelberry Studios / Big Fish / TextNow / MobilityWare / Fetch Rewards / Via [Leanplum, 03](https://www.leanplum.com/customers/case-studies)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n_Financial details:_ Leanplum was founded in 2012.

The consumer interaction garnered from the precise targeting far exceeded expectations.\" [MillenialMedia, 02](http://www.millennialmedia.com/mobile-insights/client-stories/fall-for-unilever-singapore-dove-hair-rescue)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nNexage's current privacy policy links to a URL at AOL.com, which displays privacy policy for \"Oath: A Verizon company\" [AOL, 01](http://privacy.aol.com).  \r\n\r\n_Location tracking:_ According to Oath, \"Depending on how you access and use our Services, we may receive... _Location Information._ This information can include your device's GPS signal and information about Bluetooth connections, nearby WiFi networks, cell towers, and other types of precise location. We get this information, for example, when you use location-enabled services\" [AOL, 04](http://privacy.aol.com/privacy-policy).   \r\n\r\nThey further state, \"With your consent, we may use available services on your device to determine or derive your precise location, including cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS information. In addition and with your consent, we may share your precise location information or personal information with third parties for their independent use. You may opt-out of providing precise location information to Oath, and having that information shared with third parties, at any time by adjusting the settings on your device. Please note that you may need to adjust multiple settings, and not just your location preference, to opt out of providing precise location information to Oath. If you subsequently opt in to sharing location information for an individual service, your location information will be shared with that service. Note that if you consent to share your location information within a particular app, your location information collected from within that app may continue to be shared even after you have opted-out on your device. If you opt-out of providing precise location information to Oath, we may continue to derive your approximate location from your IP address and other information we may collect. For more information, please review your app and device settings.\"  \r\n\r\n_Location tracking and third parties:_ Oath states, \"We may use third-party providers to help operate our Services, including to deliver ads and understand how people use our Services on various devices.  These providers may collect information about other apps on your various devices, the websites you visit, location information, inaudible audio waves, and other information in order to help analyze usage and target advertising on the site or app and elsewhere across your devices. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies (including audio beacons) to collect this information\" [AOL, 07](http://legal.aol.com/mobileTOS).\r\n\r\n_Other information collected:_ \r\n\r\n* Log information (interactions with web sites, search queries, information about your operating system, IP address, etc)\r\n* Device information (the type of device, such as iPhone; device identifiers which may be unique to your device; your Internet Service Provider)\r\n* \"Other information\" (such as information from AOL Mail or Instant Messenger, but not the private communications without your consent)\r\n* Third Party data: Oath states, \"We may receive additional information about you that is publicly or commercially available and combine it along with the information we have collected or received about you in other ways. Also, we receive information about you when you choose to connect with social networking services while using our Services\" [AOL, 04](http://privacy.aol.com/privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n_Mobile device information:_ Oath states, \"When you use our Services on a mobile device, Oath, our partners, and service providers may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of device you use, unique device ID, wireless mobile subscriber ISDN numbers, Verizon Wireless UIDH, IP address, operating system, browser type, and information about your use of our Services. We may use this information as described in the Oath Privacy Policy, which explains, among other things, that we may combine information about your use of our various Services in all the ways you may connect to Oath.\r\n\r\nCertain Services may require the collection of the phone number of your device. We may associate that phone number with other information; however, we will not use that number for telemarketing to you without your consent\" [AOL, 07](http://legal.aol.com/mobileTOS).\r\n\r\n_Oath Standard Categories (segments) for targeted advertising:_ See Oath website for their list of Standard Categories [AOL, 05](https://advertising.aol.com/advisibility/standard-categories).\r\n\r\n_Opt-out on mobile:_ Oath states users can opt out of interest-based (targeted) advertising through general device settings in iOS and Android. However, to stop data collection of an Oath app, users must uninstall the app.  \r\n\r\n_PII vs non-PII:_ Oath defines PII as \"name, address, telephone number, email address, payment card number, and government-issued identification number\", and non-PII to include \"without limitation cookie IDs, device identifiers, hashed values (such as email addresses and other types of information that are transformed into a sequence of random-looking characters that are no longer recognizable as an email address), and IP addresses\" [AOL, 02](http://privacy.aol.com/definitions).  \r\n\r\nOath states it abides by \"standards restricting the use of sensitive financial account number data and other types of sensitive data as defined by these programs. For example, we do not use or allow others to use sensitive data to determine eligibility for health insurance, life insurance, or employment. We also do not target ads to users based on sensitive health data, including cancer, mental health-related conditions, and sexually-related areas\". They add, \"If a user appears interested in non-sensitive, health-related topics, (such as, by visiting pages related to a topic) an ad relevant to those interests may be displayed. We may also display non-sensitive, health-related ads to users who we or our advertisers believe may be an appropriate audience for such topics\"  [AOL, 06](http://privacy.aol.com/advertising-and-privacy).\r\n\r\n_Information sharing:_ Oath states it \"may share your information in limited circumstances, including when we have your consent to do so or when sharing is necessary to protect Oath or comply with the law. Our agents and contractors may have access to your information, but only to perform services for Oath. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may, however, share non-personally identifiable information with select business partners\" [AOL, 01](http://privacy.aol.com). Oath also states it does not \"rent or sell personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. But we may share certain information we collect or receive with our affiliates and others to respond to your requests, provide our Services, when we have your consent, or as described in\" their Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nParties Oath may share data with include:\r\n\r\n* Affiliates (any company that is controlled by or under common control with Oath Inc.

If you choose to connect with a social networking service, we may share information with that service, and that service may share information about you with us. We may use the information for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy, including to make your experience on our Services more personal and social. For example, we might show you what content is popular among your connections on the social networking service or give you a glimpse of what your friends are saying about that content.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Oath, \"These and other third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Services, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on different websites and online services across your devices\" [AOL, 04](http://privacy.aol.com/privacy-policy).  \r\n\r\nKey third parties Oath works with include, but are not limited to:  \r\n\r\nAnalytics Providers:\r\n\r\n* Google Analytics\r\n* Nielsen Digital Measurement\r\n* Scorecard Research\r\n\r\nOther companies:\r\n\r\n* Acxiom\r\n* Session M\r\n* Taboola\r\n* Tapad \r\n\r\nOath states that, \"like Oath, these companies and other third parties not listed above may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies on or in connection with our Services\" [AOL, 06](http://privacy.aol.com/advertising-and-privacy).\r\n\r\n_Regulation:_ Oath is committed to self-regulatory requiremets for online advertising, including the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and the Network Advertising Initiative's Self-Regulatory Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\n_Retention:_ Oath states, \"Data used to create segments for ad targeting is retained for no longer than 2 years. Other data (for example, data used to determine long-term or seasonal trends) may be retained for as long as Oath has a legitimate business reason for retaining it\" [AOL, 06](http://privacy.aol.com/advertising-and-privacy).\r\n\r\n_Tracking technologies:_ Oath Services use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies, as well as device fingerprinting and a \"device graph\" to link multiple devices to the same user [AOL, 03](http://privacy.aol.com/cookies-web-beacons).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n_Media relationships:_ Oath offers free Services such as Oath.com, HuffPost, Moviefone, and TechCrunch with support from ads displayed on those Services.   \r\n\r\nOath brands include: #BuiltByGirls / Yahoo!

There are open source projects to do it, but even the best ones break when message quantity begins to exceed 500,000 at a time.\r\n\r\nBetter Than The Competition - Other notification services lack features such as segmentation, automatic/triggered notifications, variable substitution, a notification delivery API, or detailed reporting tools. Additionally, other services often provide low quality or out of date SDKs that do not support new platform features.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Functionality - OneSignal provides marketing tools including A/B testing, segment targeting, variable-substitution, localization, drip marketing, and conversion tracking.\r\n\r\nPlatform Support - OneSignal provides a single UI and API to deliver messages across iOS, Android, Amazon Fire, Windows Phone, Chrome Apps, Amazon Alexa, Safari, Chrome Web, and Firefox.\r\n\r\nSDK Support - OneSignal provides SDKs for nearly every major cross-platform mobile development environment, including Unity, PhoneGap, Cordova, Ionic, React Native, Intel XDK, Corona, Xamarin, Marmalade, Adobe Air, and Web Push.\r\n\r\nPopular - OneSignal is the most widely used push notification service for both web and mobile developers, with over 325,000 registered developers and 175,000 applications and websites.\r\n\r\nFree - Best of all, OneSignal is a free service that supports unlimited devices and notifications. OneSignal makes money by selling data to advertisers and research companies. We also offer paid service options for clients that require increased data privacy.",

Products and services include:\r\n\r\n* _SafeGraph Movement Panel:_ SafeGraph's \"database of ultra-accurate GPS-location data that comes from anonymized mobile devices.\" The Movement panel offers:\r\n  * _Sink detection:_ Detection of inaccurate location data based on \" specific coordinates occurring at impossibly high rates\".\r\n  * _Teleporting detection:_ Detection of inaccurate location data when \"devices appear to move at impossibly fast speeds, ostensibly traveling large distances between data points that occur next to each other\" in data streams like bid streams.\r\n  * _Jumpiness detection:_ Detection of innacurate location data when \"we see two consecutive points in time that are fairly close but still implausibly spaced\" (eg, \"the GPS receiver in your phone lags or if a nearby skyscraper interferes with the location signal\") [SafeGraph, 01](https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475)\r\n* _SafeGraph Places API:_ This \"to easily find the places of interest that are near a given lat/long, ordered by distance or relevance\" [SafeGraph, 03](https://developers.safegraph.com/docs/places.html).\r\n* _OpenLocate:_ The OpenLocate SDK will \"collect location data (like GPS) from phones\" [SafeGraph, 04](https://github.com/OpenLocate). This includes an Android and iOS SDK.  The service is built to provide developers complete control over their location data.  Developers can build location-enabled features into their apps and \"maintain complete control over how end-user data is collected, where it is stored, and which APIs it will be sent to\". This includes sending to storage services (like Amazon S3) or APIs (such as Google Places API or SafeGraph's Places API) [SafeGraph, 05](https://blog.safegraph.com/introducing-openlocate-the-open-source-location-sdk-f5c5d2739a48).\r\n\r\nOther services include:\r\n* \"Detailed polygon maps on 50+ million U.S. places of interest\r\n* Understanding of each business's popularity, taxonomy, hours, etc.\r\n* Core investments in benchmarking via truth sets\"\r\n  * This includes Explicit Truth Sets (Check-ins, Daily diaries, Web surveys) and Implicit Truth Sets (Credit card data, Receipt data, First-party transactions) \r\n\r\nData from visits may include:\r\n\r\n* _Core truth set for matching:_\r\n  * High-res GPS data\r\n  * Deterministic data\r\n  * Explicit and implicit truth\r\n  * Data collected in background from large population\r\n* _Deep places map:_\r\n  * Best polygons\r\n  * Footprint geometries\r\n  * Metadata\r\n  * Categories\r\n  * Hours of operation\r\n* Machine learning technology\r\n  * Cross-validated against multiple independent 3rd party truth sets about where people go\r\n* _Truth and accuracy_\r\n  * High Precision // Low false positive rate; High recall // Low false negative rate\" [SafeGraph, 06](https://www.safegraph.com/truth)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n_Data collection (method and use):_ SafeGraph collects data from \"trusted third-party data partners such as mobile application developers, through APIs and other delivery methods\". The data collection and use is \"governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by SafeGraph.\" SafeGraph \"aggregates data collected from our data partners, and allows third party customers to access the Data for a variety of purposes such as ad targeting, traffic analysis, and market research.\" SafeGraph may also use data for their own \"internal and operational purposes\", and share data in response to requests from law enforcement or a governmental agency, \"to protect or enforce our rights or those of others, or to investigate potential wrongdoing.\"  Data can also be transferred to a successor entity in the event of a merger or acquisition.\r\n\r\n_Information collected:_ Information collected includes \"data regarding a device\u2019s precise geographic location, as well as other mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFAs and Google Android IDs, and other information about users and their devices.\"  \r\n\r\n_Jurisdictions:_ \"SafeGraph stores and processes information on servers in many countries around the world. We therefore may process your information on a server located outside the country where you live... Our customers (or companies that help us process the Data) may be located in other countries, so the Data we provide may be processed or used in a variety of countries, other than those our users reside in.\"  Customers of SafeGraph may create cross-device capabilities \"to enable marketers to target users across various channels and devices.\"\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ SafeGraph informs users of opt-out procedures for interest-based advertising and location tracking.  To opt out of interest-based advertising, they state, users can adjust settings in their Android or iOS devices.  This procedure, which they note may change, is mentioned in the SafeGraph privacy policy \"purely for informational purposes.\"  SafeGraph further notes that \"You also can remove your consent to having your location data collected by changing the settings on your device. (Certain services may lose functionality as a result.)\"  SafeGraph's Privacy Policy provides links to the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, as well as www.youronlinechoices.com.  It informs users that these websites may provide additional opt-out options.\r\n\r\n_Retention:_ Information SafeGraph collects is \"retained indefinitely unless there has been a direct opt-out with us as directed above.\"\r\n\r\n_Security:_ SafeGraph has security policies and procedures to \" ensure compliance with industry best practices.\"  They state, \"no physical or technological safeguards are 100 percent secure, we do not guarantee the security of any particular elements of Data that we hold\" [SafeGraph, 07](https://www.safegraph.com/privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n_Clients and partners:_ Statiq / AirSage / Stanford University / GroundTruth (formerly xAd) / UCLA / Baylor University / Weborama / Tufts University / The University of Chicago / Alphonzo / Freckle IoT / Georgia Tech / Esri / Appnext / 4Info / Research Now / Tapfwd / Arrivalist / Placecast / ThinkNear by Telenav / Pitney Bowes / Columbia University / Purdue University / UC San Diego / Sidewalk Labs / Temple University / Citilabs / PlaceIQ / Moovit / Skyhook / Postie / PicsArt / Oklahoma State University / Santa Clara University / OpenLocate\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n_Financial details:_ SafeGraph was founded in 2016, and has raised $16 million from funders [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/safegraph); [SafeGraph, 02](https://blog.safegraph.com/safegraph-raises-16-million-series-a-e8e88eeb7beb)  \r\n\r\n_Scope:_ SafeGraph \"has access to super-accurate, anonymized location data on over 5% of all mobile phones in the U.S. (as of August 2017)\" and is \"increasing that percentage every day\" [SafeGraph, 01](https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475).\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_\r\n\r\n* \"SafeGraph maintains the ground truth dataset for human movement across the globe\"\r\n* \"We provide high-quality location data products to help organizations make better decisions and improve lives\"\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/safegraph](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/safegraph)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 01._ [https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475](https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 02._ [https://blog.safegraph.com/safegraph-raises-16-million-series-a-e8e88eeb7beb](https://blog.safegraph.com/safegraph-raises-16-million-series-a-e8e88eeb7beb)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 03._ [https://developers.safegraph.com/docs/places.html](https://developers.safegraph.com/docs/places.html)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 04._ [https://github.com/OpenLocate](https://github.com/OpenLocate)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 05._ [https://blog.safegraph.com/introducing-openlocate-the-open-source-location-sdk-f5c5d2739a48](https://blog.safegraph.com/introducing-openlocate-the-open-source-location-sdk-f5c5d2739a48)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 06._ [https://www.safegraph.com/truth](https://www.safegraph.com/truth)  \r\n* _SafeGraph, 07._ [https://www.safegraph.com/privacy-policy](https://www.safegraph.com/privacy-policy)\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n* _Crunchbase (SafeGraph):_ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/safegraph](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/safegraph)  \r\n* _Gigya:_ [https://www.gigya.com/blog/exploring-future-identity](https://www.gigya.com/blog/exploring-future-identity)  \r\n* _Even:_ [https://evenfinancial.com/press/mit-brings-together-fintech-financial-services-first-ever-hackathon](https://evenfinancial.com/press/mit-brings-together-fintech-financial-services-first-ever-hackathon)  \r\n* _SafeGraph:_ [https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475](https://blog.safegraph.com/less-than-10-of-bid-stream-location-data-is-high-quality-and-we-know-how-to-find-it-3a2c0df35475)  \r\n* _Stanford Economics:_ [https://web.archive.org/web/20171116110210if_/https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/sharable_fulldraft.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20171116110210if_/https://economics.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/sharable_fulldraft.pdf)  \r\n* _Washington Post:_ [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/15/politics-really-is-ruining-thanksgiving-according-to-data-from-10-million-cellphones](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/15/politics-really-is-ruining-thanksgiving-according-to-data-from-10-million-cellphones)  \r\n* _The Outline:_ [https://theoutline.com/post/2490/why-is-this-company-tracking-where-you-are-on-thanksgiving](https://theoutline.com/post/2490/why-is-this-company-tracking-where-you-are-on-thanksgiving)",

Accurately measuring location is more than just data volume; it requires models, real-world context, and the ability to observe the complete path of consumer activity.\r\n\r\nBy measuring location continuously, Placed observes when data signals shift from a single point to a cluster of points; identifying a visit has occurred.\r\n\r\nOnce a visit is identified, Placed searches its database of hundreds of millions of business features to determine the likely place of the visit.\r\n\r\nPlaced understands that location accuracy is more than a latitude and longitude. Leveraging the intelligence from Data Clustering and Place Search, the Placed Inference Model applies a statistical probability to each and every visit, bringing the highest level of accuracy to consumer location insights. The Placed Inference Model is continuously trained against millions of first-hand validation points confirmed by panelists in the field.",

Through the practices described above, we may also collect data about your Web browsing and mobile app usage behavior over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, and provide this data to third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes\" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx).  \r\n\r\nScorecardResearch provides a limited description of its services online. Some of the data listed on its website may be outdated or in need of an update. For example, there is little mention of mobile solutions: \"ScorecardResearch collects data through from two main sources: surveys and web tagging. For our surveys, we invite people on the Internet to provide us with anonymous demographic and Internet usage information that we can use to refine our reporting. These surveys are always voluntary, and are never used to collect personal information. For web tagging, participating websites agree to deploy a special code throughout their sites. Again, no personally identifiable information is ever transmitted by, or linked to, the web tags\" [ScorecardResearch, 01](https://www.scorecardresearch.com).  \r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n_Sharing with 3rd parties & mobile:_  \r\nSCR data collection and sharing: \"ScorecardResearch may use a third party service provider to obtain non-personally identifiable information and add that data to our measurements. Either ScorecardResearch or the third party service provider may initiate the process which results in this association, and this process may involve ScorecardResearch triggering the dropping of a cookie belonging to the third party service provider. We may also associate the anonymous unique identifier within the ScorecardResearch cookie on your computer or device with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies) using confidential matching procedures\" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx).  \r\n\r\n_Opting Out:_  \r\n\"If you wish to opt-out of the collection, use and transfer of app usage data for interest-based advertising on your device by Scorecard Research and other companies that participate in the DAA\u2019s AppChoices app, you may download that app onto your device and exercise your choice. AppChoices is available at the links below: \r\n\r\nDAA AppChoices iOS \r\nDAA AppChoices Android \r\nDAA AppChoices Amazon \" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)  \r\n\r\n_Mobile privacy:_    \r\n\"As part of ScorecardResearch\u2019s market research effort, participants agree to deploy ScorecardResearch web tags throughout their site. These tags send a message to ScorecardResearch that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be dropped or a mobile identifier to be accessed... ScorecardResearch uses the combination of tagging,cookies, and mobile identifiers (where relevant) to help participants count users who have visited and seen a page or various parts of a page\" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx).\r\n\r\n_Self-regulation:_  \r\n\"comScore supports the goals of the Digital Advertising Alliance, which has introduced Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. comScore requires companies that place our tags on their webpages to include a notice that its sites or applications use cookies or other identifiers that collect anonymous traffic data, and that these cookies or other identifiers may be placed by the website or by a third-party who provides services to the web site. comScore's tags are used for market research; they are not used for behavioral advertising\" [ScorecardResearch, 03](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/Principle.aspx).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\nScorecardResearch is a service of Full Circle Studies, Inc. and part of the comScore, Inc. market research group [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx).\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nIn 2012, ScorecardResearch was the third-biggest name in The Guardian's \"Tracking the Trackers\" data set [The Guardian, 01](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/scorecardresearch-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _ScorecardResearch, 01._ [https://www.scorecardresearch.com](https://www.scorecardresearch.com)  \r\n* _ScorecardResearch, 02._ [https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)  \r\n* _ScorecardResearch, 03._ [https://www.scorecardresearch.com/Principle.aspx](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/Principle.aspx)\r\n* _The Guardian, 01._ [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/scorecardresearch-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/scorecardresearch-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring)\r\n\r\n## External links\r\n* _ScorecardResearch_: [https://www.scorecardresearch.com/about.aspx](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/about.aspx)\r\n* _Full Circle Studies_: [https://www.fullcirclestudies.com](https://www.fullcirclestudies.com)  \r\n* _Ghostery (Full Circle Studies)_: [https://apps.ghostery.com/apps/scorecard_research_beacon](https://apps.ghostery.com/apps/scorecard_research_beacon)",

Tealium AudienceStream allows users to connect all of their customer data, creating a single view of customers and the ability to automate actions across every channel, touchpoint and vendor in your entire digital ecosystem\". Tealium's Audience Sizing \"allows users to connect all of their customer data, creating a single view of customers and the ability to automate actions across every channel, touchpoint and vendor in your entire digital ecosystem\" [Tealium, 04](https://tealium.com/products/audiencestream).\r\n* _Tealium DataAccess:_ DataAccess \"offers the richest source of clean and correlated omnichannel, event and audience data collected across web and mobile touch points, and makes that data available for real-time action\".

The company will use the funds to launch its product in the US and double its workforce.\" [Go4Venture, 01](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)  \r\n\r\n_Background and history:_ Formerly known as Databerries, Teemo \"reinvents offline marketing. Its mobile marketing solution combines user offline behavior understanding and algorithms to drive in-store sales. Its performance-based marketing solution delivers relevant, personalized ads that generate in-store sales it can measure. Co-founded in 2014 by Guillaume Charhon, Fran\u00e7ois Wyss and Benoit Grouchko, Teemo has 50 employees in Paris and New-York.\" [Teemo, 02](https://teemo.co/about)   \r\n\r\n\"Founded in 2014, Databerries offers brick and mortar retailers a mobile marketing solution, refferred to as Real Life Targeting, that targets mobile users based on locations they have visited in the past and measures the impact of marketing campaigns on store visits. The solution allows retailers to target users who have visited their stores and those of their competitors. The company\u2019s technology collects geolocation and navigation data from mobile users and targets them with relevant and personalised ads. This allows retailers to generate store visits with a significantly lower cost per physical visit (CPV). Databerries enables retailers to count the cost per visit and therefore measure the impact of a campaign on point-of-sale traffic, offering retailers a solution that works for offline marketing while combining online advertising standards such as accurate targeting, personalisation, performance measurement and return on investment optimisation.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Paris, Databerries employs 40 people and plans to double its workforce by the end of 2017. Since its launch, the solution has generated more than one million in-store visits and supports more than 20 prestigious advertisers on a daily basis. It serves more than 100 brick and mortar retailers including Carrefour, Decathlon, FNAC, Leclerc, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) and Volkswagen (ETR: VOW3).\r\n\r\nAccording to the company, offline retailers spend more than $100bn (\u20ac93.9bn) on advertising every year, relying largely on outdoor and other offline channels to increase store visits with limited ability to track the performance of their advertising campaigns. According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the cross-platform and mobile advertising market is estimated to grow from $25.2bn (\u20ac23.7bn) in 2015 to $80.5bn (\u20ac75.6bn) by 2020, at a CAGR of 26.1%.\" [Go4Venture, 01](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)\r\n\r\n_Slogans:_ \r\n* \"Real-life Targeting, Offline Measurement\" \r\n* \"Reinventing offline marketing\"\r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Android (Google Android ID) and Apple (IDFA)\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databerries](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databerries)\r\n* _Teemo, 01._ [http://teemo.co](http://teemo.co)  \r\n* _Teemo, 02._ [https://teemo.co/about](https://teemo.co/about) \r\n* _Teemo, 03._ [https://teemo.co/sdkguidelines](https://teemo.co/sdkguidelines)   \r\n* _Teemo, 04._ [https://teemo.co/privacy](https://teemo.co/privacy)\r\n\r\n## External Links\r\n* _Go4Venture, 01:_ [http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries](http://go4venture.com/hti/usd-16m-a-mar-2017-databerries)  \r\n* _L'Expansion, 01:_ [https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/high-tech/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html](https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/high-tech/teemo-la-start-up-qui-traque-10-millions-de-francais-en-continu_1937638.html)",

Some news outlets have published details about Tinder analytical practices, often in conjunction with third parties. Minor press about Tinder and \"swiping right\" offers clues:\r\n\r\n\"Earlier this year, to combat this collection of overzealous swipers, the company set a limit on the number of right swipes users could make daily. Then it rounded up profiles of the most prolific right-swipers and watched what happened. Would they get upset and leave? Would they stop using for a while and lick their wounds? Or would they realize the error in their ways and be a little more discriminating in suggesting possible hookups?\" [Fortune, 01](http://fortune.com/2015/09/29/tinder-interana-analytics/)\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nThe privacy policy for the Tinder Analytics SDK tracker is not public. In September 2017, French journalist Judith Duportail published details about her data request from Tinder which revealed that Tinder had 800 pages of information about her. The profile was created over four years of use, and included information about her Facebook \"likes\", links to (now-deleted) Instagram photos, her education, the age-rank of men she was interested in, number of Facebook friends, the when and where of every one of her Tinder match conversations, and more [The Guardian, 01](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/26/tinder-personal-data-dating-app-messages-hacked-sold).\r\n\r\n### General Tinder Privacy Policy\r\n_PII:_ Tinder collects Personal Information (Personally Identifiable Information), including Sensitive Data, and other information.

We may also share your geolocation information in de-identified form with Match Group companies and third parties for the above purposes.\"  \r\n\r\n_Opt-Out (geolocation:_ \"To opt out of the sharing of your geolocation information, please discontinue use of the Tinder application\".\r\n\r\n_Opt-Out (third party):_ Some \"third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org).

While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer personal information or other information to our offices outside of the United States.

The TMC \"is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data, Email Addresses, and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution, app store optimization, and in-app marketing. Advertisers are able to view and measure data provided by TUNE, as well as third-party Partners that the Advertiser selects, in the TMC. For instance, an Advertiser can compare the results of advertising campaigns conducted with different Partners in the TMC. Advertisers and Partners may also send information to the TMC via Postback\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\nTUNE products and services offered include:\r\n\r\n* _In-App Marketing:_ Leverage customer segmentation tools and contextual insight to send personalized messages, guide users through from onboarding to conversion, and take action with real-time reporting, A/B testing, and optimization. Features include location-based triggers, deep links, automatic actions, automated triggers, and scheduled campaigns [TUNE, 02](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/in-app-marketing).\r\n* _TUNE Marketing Console:_ \r\n* * Track user behavior on and offline, across devices, via TUNE's understanding of the \"customer journey\".\r\n* * Uniques identify users and target their \"proximity\" via location tracking.\r\n* * Help clients to \"Streamline your mobile marketing and measurement\" with services that are \"people-centric\". \r\n* * Unify data into one place, and give ownership of the data to the client. \r\n* * TUNE's APIs allows clients to sync with thousands of integrated partners [TUNE, 03](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/our-difference).\r\n* _Attribution Analytics:_ TUNE offers mobile analytics based on detailed performance reports and people-centric segmentation to maximize return on investment; analytics for re-engagement; analytics for return on ad spend; as well as analytics for fraud prevention [TUNE, 04](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/attribution-analytics).\r\n* _App Store Analytics:_ TUNE provides tools to optimize success in app stores [ TUNE, 05](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/app-store-analytics).\r\n* _Fraud prevention:_ TUNE Fraud services identify install and click fraud, allows businesses to set custom fraud rules, and provides analytics to detect and classify potential fraud [TUNE, 06](https://www.tune.com/solutions/tune-marketing-console/mobile-ad-fraud-detection-prevention)  \r\n\r\nTUNE is \"a 'data processor' that collects and analyzes End User data at the specific request of our client Advertisers, the 'data controllers'\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\nTUNE also tracks in-app user behavior and correlates it with a unique identifier [TUNE, 07](https://developers.tune.com/sdk/measuring-in-app-events).\r\n\r\nA simple version of TUNE's targeted advertising is provided on their opt-out website. It is explained as follows:  \r\n\r\n\"Within the TMC, two features allow advertisers to use data to target advertising to an end user:\r\n\r\n1. AUDIENCES allows Advertisers to build segments based on previously acquired attribution data (from the TMC's Attribution Analytics feature)...\r\n2. IN APP MARKETING allows advertisers to send end users push notifications outside of the app environment, as well as in-app messages - for promotional and other activities...\" [TUNE, 09](http://www.optoutmobile.com).\r\n\r\nIn this context, TMC covers \"Attribution Analytics, App Store Analytics, Audiences, and In-App Marketing\" [TUNE, 10](https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy).\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\nTUNE \"defines privacy as the end user\u2019s rights to receive notice, give consent, and opt-out of the collection, use, and sharing of data that is about or can identify that end user\".\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ TUNE has an opt-out website, www.optoutmobile.com, which details how end users can opt out of features in the TUNE Marketing Console (TMC) that target users online. Users can opt out of the \"audiences\" segment-based targeted advertising if they \"enable Limit Ad Tracking or \u201cLAT\u201d or re-set their ad identifier on their device OR opt out within the app itself\". They can opt out of \"in app marketing\" if they \"use the appropriate settings on their mobile platform (Android, iPhone, or Windows)\". Additional details of how to opt out of mobile on the outoutmobile.com website.  TUNE will pass on LAT requests to Advertisers, and will honor opt-outs provided to them by Advertisers. They also honor push notification opt outs set by the End User on their device.  \r\n\r\nOpting out of the TMC \"will not stop those users from receiving interest-based advertisements from Advertisers or other publishers or ad networks. End Users who want to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or Advertiser\u2019s ads must contact those companies directly to opt out.\"\r\n\r\n_Data ownership (TMC):_ \"Unless otherwise specified, and pursuant to the TUNE Data Pledge, Advertisers own the data that they provide to and collect through the TMC. When Advertisers remove or export their data from the TMC, their use of End User data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.\"    \r\n\r\n_Data collected (TMC):_ The TMC \"is designed to collect and use data such as Unique Advertising Identifiers, Statistical Identifiers, Geographic Location Data, Email Addresses, and other data provided by the Advertiser for attribution, app store optimization, and in-app marketing.\"  \r\n\r\n_Data sharing (TMC):_ Advertisers \"are able to view and measure data provided by TUNE, as well as third-party Partners that the Advertiser selects, in the TMC. For instance, an Advertiser can compare the results of advertising campaigns conducted with different Partners in the TMC. Advertisers and Partners may also send information to the TMC via Postback\"... Advertisers can share all data collected through the TMC with Partners via Postback, data exports, and/or API calls\". TUNE itself may provide or disclose, or enable others to provide, End User Data for the purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity of invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so.\"   \r\n\r\n_Personally identifiable information:_ \"The TMC does not primarily rely on data that is considered \u201cpersonal\u201d in other jurisdictions for Attribution and App Store Optimization. The TMC does support automatic hashing in cases where the Advertiser chooses to upload \u201cpersonal\u201d data into the TMC to ensure that the TMC does not process such data in raw form\".

Weborama recorded revenues of 24.3 million Euros in 2012 [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); revenues \"reached \u20ac29 million in 2016\" [Weborama, 05](https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures).  Operating income was up in early 2017.  A recently signed international agreement with \"a leading media/marketing player...will especially enable Weborama to grow its presence in the United States.\" [Weborama, 06](https://www.weborama.com/documents/2017/09/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf)\r\n\r\n_Growth:_ Weborama had 110 million profiles in 2013; this suggests a growth of 300 million profiles in just 4 years [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf); [Weborama, 07](https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment)\r\n\r\n_Devices:_ Web browsers / Trackers in mobile apps\r\n\r\n### Methods\r\n_Data assets:_ Weborama has \"400 million profiles in the European database\" and \"More than 200 socio-demo, behavioural and intenders criteria\". This is used for \"data solutions\" for advertisers; the Audience Manager gives \"an exclusive and native access to 400 million profiles in Europe\" with a \"360\u00b0 view of behavioural and socio-demographic data\".  Audience Insight \"allows viewing the audience structure by age, gender and occupation, along with the distribution of behavioural segments and clusters\", which \"helps publishers to drill down into their audience profile in real time, and thereby to maximise its monetisation\" [Weborama, 04](https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering).\r\n\r\nWeborama tags placed on a publisher's website allows them to \"collect raw and anonymous navigation data\".  They conduct \"Audience analysis, followed by a relevant and targeted marketing proposal\" to be \"conducted within three weeks from the date Weborama tags\" the website [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)\r\n\r\nWeborama \"collects anonymous user navigation data via a network of several thousands of partner websites. These websites make it possible for Weborama to store cookies on users\u2019 browsers to allow for their anonymous identification and tracking over the Internet. Navigation data collected by Weborama only includes non-personally identifiable information (NPII) such as URL pages, software equipment, keywords used for searching, geographic location (at state or city level), and advertising interaction history\" [Weborama, 07](https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment).\r\n\r\n_Location targeting:_ \"Generate qualified traffic in store thanks geolocation\" [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/2017/09/retail-which-dmps-use-cases)  \r\n\r\n_Big Data:_ \"Data is at the heart of its expertise, thanks to its strategists, data consultants, computer linguists, statisticians, mathematicians and developers.  Big Data is the driver of development today at Weborama, and will continue to be in the future. Great cares are taken to collect data anonymously, internet user benefits from more relevant advertising.\" [Weborama, 02](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation)\r\n\r\n_Semantic processing: Cookies, segmenting, & survey:_ \"the data is sourced anonymously from 300,000 sites, using cookies, then processed instantly. this audience classification is a critical process within each database. thanks to this methodology Weborama has a database of 110 million profiles of behavioural, socio-demographic, and purchasing intent data in Europe, 70 million of which are from France. Today, Weborama has identified almost 200 clusters (centres of interest) based on the behaviour of internet users, divided into 23 segments (a segment being a \u201cfamily\u201d of clusters). Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic database is built from a sample group of 300,000 active internet users in France who responded willingly to a questionnaire giving their age, gender and socio-professional category. by cross-referencing  behavioural clusters with Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic sample group, the sample group data are extrapolated from the database as a whole\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n_Patented technologies based on algorithms and the automatic processing of language:_ 33 million active URLs; 300,000 sites analysed each day; 110 million active profiles per month; 3.5 million qualified internet users per day; 25 words per day per internet user.\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n\r\n_Knowledge: 3rd party & 1st party data:_ The Weborama 3rd party database enriches 1st party data.  3rd party data is \"Data from a third party which do not belong to the advertiser or publisher, but are made available to them for deployment in online marketing\", whereas 1st party data is \"Data belonging to an advertiser or publisher.\"\r\n\r\n_Audience Segmentation & Targeted Advertising:_ With big data collections, Weborama can identify \"look-alikes\" of internet users with a similar profile to those who \"transform\" (\"subscriptions to products offered in the campaign\").  \"This allows them to be offered advertising which is personalised to fit their profile\".  Audience segmentation in media campaigns was introducted by an advertiser in 2012; the advertiser was looking to increase the level of transformation while reducing loss of media investments, and called upon Weborama to build a mechanism for its commercial catalogue.  Weborama creates a database, including from data collected by advertisers, and builds a targeted advertising model, which includes a model training phase and A/B testing.  \r\n\r\nData mining is conducted as follows: \"this database is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\"  Search and surf data is used; Weborama then views transactions over weeks, and observes outcomes from users in the database which includes 60 million qualified profiles over approximatley 300 columns, including ads viewed, reactions (visit, click), behavior on the website visited, and socio-demographic and behavioral profile.    \r\n\r\nTraining the model is conducted as follows: From the database, build graphic representation and create permanent tree segments. The criteria most relevant to each product or service can be extracted, where the criteria is based on transformation of the internet users exposed to ad campaigns and impressions.\r\n\r\nWeborama's database \"is then enriched with socio-demographic and behavioural criteria for internet users whose profile is known to Weborama, thanks to their database of 70 million qualified profiles in France. this data is cross-referenced with the data coming from Weborama Campaign Manager. this anonymous information is accessible as a whole using the internet user identifier (a series of characters for each individual contained in the cookies deposited in the internet explorer). this unique identifier allows Weborama to find the complete profile of the internet user in their database, in real time.\" \r\n\r\nWeborama runs A/B testing to determine if the model is working, based on confidence intervals.  Variation can occur for many reasons, such as a calendar event or a holiday. \r\n\r\n_Segmentation for publishers:_ \"Above all, the aim of publishers is to organise their commercial products so that they can offer advertisers and agencies, in addition to the contextual menu, packs of targeted audiences, enriched by 3rd party data. the second challenge is to build specific audience packs using ad hoc target segments based on both socio-demographic and behavioural targeting (taking account of the internet users\u2019 different areas of interest).  \"Segmentation of a site\u2019s audience allows visitor profiles \r\nfrom other areas of interest to be seen. It is highly probable that a current affairs site has, among its audience, people who enjoy other sites (finance, beauty, fashion, cookery, travel...). this will offer the publishers the possibility of assessing their content quality, as well as that of their audience, while expanding their client base. \" \r\n\r\n_Two methods of data enrichment from publishers:_ The first method \"includes the synchronisation and propagation of Weborama\u2019s socio-demographic criteria and behavioural clusters on the publisher\u2019s site audience. this is possible by identifying profiles recognised within the site\u2019s audience, which are already part of the Weborama database. In this particular case, the adserver of the publisher calls the Weborama database for each internet user. If the Weborama database recognises the socio-demographic profile or behaviour of the visitor to the site, the visitor is transferred to the publisher\u2019s adserver. the publisher\u2019s adserver therefore now contains the socio-demographic and behavioural profile of the majority of its internet users.\"  \r\n\r\nThe second method \"identifies and analyses the website user\u2019s profiles to create ad hoc target users relevant to the advertisers\u2019 areas of activity.\"  Here Weborama creates _ad hoc_ profiles, and then there is a \"transfer of ad hoc target users\": \"the transfer of ad hoc users defined above is possible using a list of different adserver pixels. this transfer is done by a call of the pixels generated by the publisher\u2019s adserver. the volume of profiles per target required are then available directly in the adserver\" [Weborama, 03](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* _Crunchbase, 01._ [https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weborama](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/weborama)\r\n* _Weborama, 01._ [https://www.weborama.com](https://www.weborama.com)\r\n* _Weborama, 02._ [https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation](https://www.weborama.com/data/presentation)  \r\n* _Weborama, 03._ [http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf](http://www.weborama.com/documents/2013/06/data-according-to-weborama.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 04._ [https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering](https://www.weborama.com/data/the-offering)  \r\n* _Weborama, 05._ [https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures](https://www.weborama.com/infos-financieres/financial-figures)  \r\n* _Weborama, 06._ [https://www.weborama.com/documents/2017/09/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf](https://www.weborama.com/documents/2017/09/weborama-growth-of-the-operating-profit-in-the-first-half-of-2017.pdf)  \r\n* _Weborama, 07._ [https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment](https://www.weborama.com/e-privacy/our-commitment)\r\n \r\n## External Links\r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, French):_ [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama)  \r\n* _Wikipedia (Weborama, English translation):_ [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama&prev=search](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weborama&prev=search)",

        "description": "What is segmentation?\r\n\r\nSegmentation is the activity of dividing your audience into sub-groups known as segments based on some type of shared characteristics.\r\n\r\nWonderPush provides pre-configured segments such as New users or Dormant users, and you can also create your own segments based on criteria relevant to your business.\r\nUsing segments to send notifications\r\n\r\nWonderPush lets you send notifications to one or more segments.\r\n\r\nUsing segments allows you to send more relevant, targeted notifications to a sub-group of your audience. In our experience, sending relevant notifications contributes to a better user experience, generates more clicks and less users unsubscribing.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples where segmentation can be used to send relevant notifications:\r\n\r\n    an e-commerce website can send discounts to customers that haven't purchased in a while,\r\n    a news outlet can notify its readers interested in economics of a new piece on the subject,\r\n    another news outlet might notify users in a particular city of a transportation strike.\r\n\r\nTo send a notification to one or more segments, use the Target tab of the notification edition page.\r\nEvents, tags and properties\r\n\r\nIn order to create segments relevant to your business, WonderPush can collect 3 types of data: events, tags and properties.\r\n\r\nWonderPush lets you specify criteria based on this data to create your own segments.\r\nEvents\r\n\r\nEvents are sent when interesting things take place in the user journey. Events may contain additional information about what happened. A few common examples of events are:\r\n\r\n    user purchased something\r\n    user read an article\r\n    user added something to his/her cart.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Events and how to collect them.\r\nTags\r\n\r\nTags are like labels you can stick on users. Common examples of tags include:\r\n\r\n    \u201cCustomer\u201d, a tag added whenever one makes a purchase,\r\n    \u201cEconomics\u201d, \u201cFootball\u201d, or as many categories a reader of a news outlet might want to subscribe to.\r\n\r\nFind out more about Tags and how to set them.\r\nProperties\r\n\r\nProperties are key/value pairs where the value can be of types such as integer, floating-point number, boolean, string, etc. Typical properties are:\r\n\r\n    a user's age (integer),\r\n    a user's full name (string),\r\n    a customer's all-time generated revenue (floating-point).\r\n\r\nFind out more about Properties and how to set them.",

Our objective here is simple: offer these users a tool which will help them find the value in their data, step by step, and then help them share the data so that the most can be made of it. To that end, Explorer offers tools that let you work with and refine your data indefinitely notably via filters, drill-downs, on-the-fly segmentation, and custom cross-calculations.  \r\n\r\n...with just one click, the analyst can access Data Query to extract data via our API, and then activate that data by creating relevant retargeting campaigns, for example.\r\n\r\nThe analyst can also transform the analysis into a KPI to be directly displayed in a dashboard, thanks to Explorer\u2019s integration in the Analytics Suite. This KPI will allow business users to understand what\u2019s happening, follow the KPI\u2019s evolution, and potentially implement actions as a result\" [Ad Internet, 03](https://blog.atinternet.com/en/interview-finding-the-value-in-your-data-step-by-step).  \r\n\r\n_Mobile developments:_  \r\n\r\n\"There are also mobile features that continue to be developed. For example, we are working on the analysis of the customer journey, which is now done on several devices. This cross-device tracking is simple in theory, because in practice, it's more complicated than just following log-in users ... Above all, unlike others, we are very concerned about the respect of Internet users, and everything must be done with their consent, in accordance with the law. We have many other features in preparation. We will also work on marking and its reliability, a \"smart SDK\" for mobile apps, a tool to know the traffic pages and links by surfing the site, or a benchmark mobile apps using data from the app stores\" [JDN, 01](http://www.journaldunet.com/solutions/analytics/1179294-mathieu-llorens-at-internet-ces-4-millions-d-euros-vont-nous-aider-a-passer-un-nouveau-cap).  \r\n\r\nXiTi will \"examine any profiling activities done on their advertising networks, especially when analytics data is being used to establish this profiling\" [At Internet, 02, PDF](https://www.atinternet.com/uploads/Digital-Analytics-the-GDPR-5-Things-You-Must-Know.pdf).\r\n\r\n_Trackers:_  \r\n\r\n* Android initialisation (see [AT Internet, 06](https://developers.atinternet-solutions.com/android-en/getting-started-android-en/tracker-initialisation-android-en))  \r\n* Apple iOS (see [AT Internet, 07](https://developers.atinternet-solutions.com/apple-en/getting-started-apple-en/configuration-apple-en))  \r\n* JavaScript (see [AT Internet, 08](https://developers.atinternet-solutions.com/javascript-en/getting-started-javascript-en/tracker-initialisation-javascript-en))\r\n\r\n## Privacy Policy\r\n\r\n_Personal Data:_ XiTi states, \"By default, AT Internet considers all data related to IP address, GPS location and cookies as personal data.

AT Internet has the resources required to retrieve, edit or erase any personal data in a timely manner. We will liaise directly with end users on this matter when necessary.

This information is clearly accessible in our privacy policy, and in our customer contracts.\"  \r\n\r\n_Co-Responsibility:_ \"Under the GDPR, when two different organisations (\u201cdata controllers\u201d) work together to establish the purpose and means of processing personal data, they are considered \u201cjoint controllers\u201d and share responsibility. Joint controllers must together determine the details of their \u201crespective responsibilities\u201d for GDPR compliance, especially as it relates to their duties in responding to data subject requests.\"\r\n\r\n\"... AT Internet\u2019s Analytics  Suite is GDPR-compliant. We therefore commit to sharing full responsibility with our customers for any potential privacy breaches and sanctions under the GDPR. We will provide each of our customers with a contract addendum \u2013 a Data Protection Agreement, or DPA \u2013 to precisely define the scope of responsibility. If you work with a different digital analytics provider, we strongly recommend you verify the terms of your contract to ensure that responsibility is not automatically transferred to you (via limitations on liability clauses).\"  \r\n\r\n_Purposes of Analytics / Cominations and Correlations with Other Customer Data:_ \"Under the GDPR, personal data must only be \"collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.\" In other words, your visitors\u2019 data should only be used to achieve the specific thing(s) you\u2019ve informed them of, such as (in the case of analytics) improving their experience on your site, or providing them with tailored content. Your visitors\u2019 data should NOT be used in other ways for which they have not given consent.\"  Data profiling requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) \" to determine how this profiling affects the protection of your users\u2019 personal data.\"  \r\n\r\n\"... With AT Internet, you always remain the owner of your data. We never use or merge our customers\u2019 analytics data for our own purposes. We do not carry out any profiling activities, and in light of the GDPR, we strongly encourage our customers and prospects to carefully any profiling activities done on their advertising networks, especially when analytics data is being used to establish this profiling.\"\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n\"AT Internet has more than 3,800 web analytics customers worldwide from all industries, including more than half of the companies listed on the French stock exchange (CAC 40), as well as many other leading international groups.\" \r\n\r\n\"The power of AT Internet\u2019s Analytics Suite and the quality of its services (consulting, training and support) are recognised worldwide.\" XiTi is \" in all industries\", including \"e-commerce, media, finance/banking, corporate institutions...

Data collected through \"via Client Digital Properties for the Platform includes: the date/time for a visit to a Client Digital Property, referrer information such as what search engine and search keywords Users may have used to get to a Client Digital Property, information about the browser or device your User is on such as their Operating System, as well as the city/country location of Users, and any pseudonymous tokens and mobile advertising IDs (e.g., IDFA in iOS). In addition, our Clients can choose what other User data they want to collect and store on the platform such as an IP address, location information, a User\u2019s age, user names, real names, email addresses and other custom data points as determined by each Client.\"  \r\n\r\nmParticle places restrictions on data practices. They state, \"We contractually prohibit Clients from placing sensitive information (e.g., passwords, authentication credentials, credit cards, social security or driver\u2019s license numbers) or information that is deemed sensitive by applicable law or self-regulatory codes such as the Digital Advertising Alliance. mParticle functions strictly as the data processing agent of our Clients.

However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error. Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business\".\r\n\r\n_Data retention:_ mParticle \"retains Client data for so long as you remain are a Client and will delete Client\u2019s information within 12 months of either party\u2019s termination of applicable Client agreement upon written request. We retain User level data on the Platform as directed by our Clients and for a reasonable time thereafter for audit purposes and as otherwise required by law\".\r\n\r\n_Opt-out:_ mParticle has an email-based opt-out procedure for Clients, but does not list opt-out procedures for End Users on its Privacy Policy web page. The opt-out procedure for Clients is as follows: \"You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from mParticle by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your mParticle projects or our ongoing business relationship. An individual wishing to limit the use or sharing of their data should contact email support@mparticle.com. mParticle will respond within ninety (90) days to any request to delete your information. Individuals who have provided information directly to one of mParticle\u2019s Clients must send follow-up requests to change or delete such information to that particular mParticle Client\"\r\n\r\n_International law:_ mParticle complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework [mParticle, 12](https://www.mparticle.com/privacypolicy).\r\n\r\n## Relationships\r\n_Customers:_ Airbnb / King / Spotify / Jet / EA / SeatGeek / Ticketmaster / Gilt / Bleacher Report / Chick-fil-A / Postmates / Lilly Pulitzer [mParticle, 01](https://www.mparticle.com) / Venmo / Via / Stash / Starwood Preferred Guest / Draft / StockTwits / OKCupid / NBCUniversal / Turner / theSkimm / Lakes Fifth Avenue / Lululemon Athletica / Goat / Live Nation [mParticle, 02](https://www.mparticle.com/customers) / Walmart [mParticle, 03](https://www.mparticle.com/news/mparticle-gartner-magic-quadrant-digital-marketing-hubs) / iHeartRadio / Starwood / SoulCycle [mParticle, 04](https://www.mparticle.com/news/mparticle-raises-15-million-series-a-led-by-social-capital)  \r\n\r\n_Integrations:_ mParticle offers \"Full-featured integrations with the top marketing, advertising, analytics, and data warehousing platforms\".
