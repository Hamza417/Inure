## About

Inure is an Android application package manager irrespective of whether they're installed or not, it
can scan through any app's internal components and modify them on the go. It also packs a nice
looking Terminal Emulator, Usage Stats, Split/APK Installer and various other tools and many of them
are waiting to be implemented as well. On top of that, Inure's all functionalities been made to
work with both Root and Shizuku modes.

Inure's development was started as an independent learning project which later has become one of the
most ambitious and intuitive Android apps developed by a single person and is based 100% on custom
UI APIs developed to be used only in this app with its own native theme engine, crash handler, image
renderer and a beautiful animation framework.

Along with it own UI perks, Inure also supports dynamic Material You colors with dedicated accent
and theme color modes.

The app is in stable testing stage. You can join
app's [Telegram Group](https://t.me/inure_app_manager)
and get development related updates.

**Inure also supports fully reproducible builds**

### Accessibility

Various accessibility features to make the app more accessible to users. Inure also supports an
option to add more colors to interface of various
types including Pastel, Coffee (soothing) and Retro (color blocked) for users who don't prefer
monochromatic interface or have difficulty using it.

Including that, Inure also supports highlighting clickable elements and divider for users who
have difficulty in differentiating spaces between interface elements.

Further more, it's also possible to disable all animations to reduce excessive motion in the
app. Inure has options to adjust animation requirements over multiple levels from all animations to no 
animations with fine granularity.

### Menus and Dialogs

Inure has 3 different styles of Menu and Dialogs type depending on how they're required, the popup type used for quick actions follows the user thumb on the screen,
the modal dialog is used to adjust panel level preferences and chip style dialog for managing filter flags and tags. These three work together to refine a good level
of UX and UI without overloading the user with a lot of options.

### Visually Challenged Users

Inure is designed to be as user friendly as possible despite its complexities. For users with visual difficulties, it come across to cause really low confusion while browsing through its interface and processing the displayed
information through a screen reader. A user with such difficulty has demoonstrated the ease of use of the app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alDrMfqaN44).

**If you've any questions or suggestions for design, please initiate a discussion or create an issue.**

## Contribute

#### Include your app in Inure's FOSS panel

If you are a developer and want your app to be listed in the FOSS panel of Inure and show a
FOSS indicator alongside your app, there are two ways this can be done.

1. You can publish your app on F-Droid. Inure automatically marks the app as FOSS if it's available
   on F-Droid.
2. You can add `open_source` and `open_source_license` tag in your app's manifest file and Inure
   will fetch this info during the runtime and will include your app based on the flag.

```xml
<application
   .....
   >
   
   <!-- Set to true to indicate the app is open source -->
   <meta-data
      android:name="open_source"
      android:value="true" />
   
   <!-- License of your app -->
   <meta-data
      android:name="open_source_license"
      android:value="GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3" />

</application>
```

    - [Positional](https://github.com/Hamza417/Positional)
    - [Flaner](https://github.com/Hamza417/Flaner)
    - **Beatz** (private)
